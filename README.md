## 01 Enhancing Lectures

Here are two examples demonstrating how ChatGPT can be used to rapidly create interactive polls/quizes for your lectures to increase student comprehension and engagement.

2. [Using ChatGPT-4 to create a Kahoot!](https://youtu.be/tu1Bbhw3wxM)

Here's my ChatGPT 4 [transcript](enhancing_lectures/chatgpt4_transcript.txt?raw=true).

## 02 Creating Formative Activities

In this example, I show how you can generate a comprehension quiz for Canvas based on the paper by Dwivedi et. al.

## 03 Developing Teaching Resources

In this example, I use ChatGPT to create a resource for an active learning workshop: "Introductionto R and ggplot". This workshop was delivered as a part [HiPy](https://www.hipy.org.uk) event at UoL on 6 March 2023.

## 04 Assistive Feedback

R. Treharne, J. Foster and K. Atkins have created a tool that leverages ChatGPT 3.5 to provide consistent feedback concerning reference lists on Canvas submissions. 

See the tool in action [here](https://youtu.be/hJAWgO_3SgE?si=ZglFtDv7K3wbnlhn).

The tool does the following:

+ Downloads all submissions associated with a Canvas assignment
+ Extracts reference lists for each submission
+ Generates feedback comment on quality of reference list based on well designed prompt
+ Generates a full excel report for module organiser
+ Posts comments to submissions as feedback for students (optional)

The tool is fully documented and available at: https://github.com/rtreharne/assistive_feedback

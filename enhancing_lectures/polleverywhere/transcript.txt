I just lost my. Okay.
0:01
So new week, new topic in 748.
0:06
This is a slightly different title to the one in the in the handbook.
0:11
But basically what we're going to be trying to do in the next couple of weeks is understand how structural binds traumatic.
0:15
So predicting and analysing the structure of proteins can help us predict their functions as well.
0:23
So how does this fits in with the rest of the module?
0:29
Well, in the module so far you've been doing a lot about genome sequencing alignment, assembly gene finding.
0:32
All of that is great,
0:40
but it doesn't count for very much in terms of the biological understanding unless we can understand what all of those genes are actually doing.
0:41
Most of those genes encode for proteins. A protein structure encodes its functions.
0:49
So logically we can tell a lot more about a protein function by explicitly considering its sort of structural aspects.
0:55
And that's really what these lectures are about, lectures and workshops.
1:03
So that will lead in hopefully to your genome report assessment.
1:10
So in that assessment, which is run by Professor Bettencourt, I don't know all the details,
1:14
but I know you're invited in that assessment to consider the structure and what
1:19
that tells you about some of the genes that you find in your genome of interest.
1:25
So this should be the icing on the cake, if you like, for your genome report assessment.
1:30
So we've got two weeks each with a lecture and an accompanying workshop.
1:41
What we're going to do and there's going to be a bit of a reminder at the beginning.
1:46
So there's some slides you saw before and 7 to 1 because we talked a little bit about protein structure,
1:50
then a little bit, just to remind you about four fold,
1:55
especially how to interpret the results of Alpha four because of course,
1:59
and the protein structure prediction world Alpha Fold has taken over from everything else basically.
2:03
And then today we'll start I've called them simple.
2:10
That's crap. Setting them down. They're not necessarily unsophisticated,
2:13
but they're kind of long standing ideas about how we can look at a protein structure and read out something interesting about its function.
2:17
And then next week we'll be moving on to talk about protein interactions.
2:26
So one protein and complex with another alpha fold can also predict that Alpha fold can also be
2:30
induced to predict more sophisticated things like multiple confirmations per particular protein,
2:38
which of course is very relevant to understanding that protein function.
2:44
And then in the second week, we'll also be looking at some of the very latest, literally in the last year, last month, last year,
2:49
deep learning based methods will take a protein structure and try and read
2:55
something out pretty much directly by application of some deep learning method.
3:00
Tells you something about what that protein is doing. And I meant to say at the beginning, but this is such a small class.
3:05
It's been years and years. I haven't had a class like this, so I hope you feel free to sort of stick your hand up at any point,
3:13
and I hope you'll be answering the questions that I might throw at you rather than the usual sort of silent, invisible crowd of people I usually get.
3:20
So. So why is I mean, this is just a quick reminder.
3:28
I won't spend too much time on this. Why should we model proteins?
3:35
In other words, predict their 3D structure,
3:38
And it's all about understanding their function better because ultimately the function of a protein is how it interacts with other
3:41
molecules and how it interacts with other molecules and which of the molecules it can interact with depends on its 3D shape.
3:49
The shape of a protein and its characteristics allow it to interact with and possibly do some chemistry on other molecules.
3:57
So understanding and understanding the structure of the protein should allow us a much more direct readout of what its function is.
4:05
And as you'll see today and next week, there are many, many different ways in which we can feed a computer program,
4:19
a protein structure, and hope it can tell us something about the function.
4:26
There's all sorts of different ideas in this area. This isn't the first time you've been thinking about protein function.
4:31
Of course, we did that a lot in 7 to 1.
4:38
So what are some of the sequence based programs that you saw in 7 to 1 that might tell you something about protein function?
4:40
Blast. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Except actually. But yeah, blast psi blast.
4:49
The kind of domain analysis is looking for domains. There are always sequence based ways of looking at protein function,
4:54
but the simple methods at least will never tell you anything new because they're all based on transferring knowledge from one protein to another.
5:01
So all of the completely novel functions, which we have to assume are still out there to be discovered,
5:10
Blast isn't going to help you with that because those novel discovery functions have never actually been described yet,
5:16
whereas if you have a structure, you might be able to analyse that structure in detail and say,
5:23
I think this protein has some function that's never been seen before and that's a completely different position to be in.
5:28
So some of the very simple ways in which in which we can.
5:36
Which we can look at the structure and read out something about its function.
5:44
We'll see these in a bit more detail later on. But sometimes just the fold of a protein might lead us to have a particular idea about what it does.
5:49
So there are certain protein folds, ways of protein folds up, which are strongly associated with a particular function.
5:58
And if we saw those in a crystal structure cry, we have a structure, and a model doesn't really matter where we might start to say,
6:06
well, this for what I've seen before, many times in DNA binding proteins, maybe this new protein I'm interested in also binds DNA.
6:14
We'll look at electrostatic because where you get a big strong electrostatic surface like here,
6:24
that's often not by chance, that's often telling you something about what molecules that protein combine to.
6:31
So blue here means positive.
6:37
There's a big positive patch that suggests maybe is some big negatively charged molecule that this protein is waiting to bind to.
6:39
And the very simple idea of just looking at the protein shape and looking for cavities.
6:49
And if you knew nothing about this protein at all, you might guess quite reasonably or predict that it was binding something in this cavity,
6:55
because that's where the binding, the function tends to be encoded.
7:03
So that's that's kind of why we're doing it. And we'll come into the details later on.
7:08
How we're doing it these days is often is typically about generating a model with Alpha fold and seeing what that tells us.
7:13
So it's important that we can interpret the alpha fold outputs.
7:21
It's important that we can say, Yes, this model looks great.
7:26
I can treat this model almost as if it's a crystal structure because I think this model is really high quality.
7:31
Or alternatively, this model doesn't look good at all.
7:36
I probably should be very reticent about reading anything into this model because even Alpha Fold is not saying it's not confident in this model.
7:40
So you need to be able to understand this the quality, the predicted quality of your model in order to be able to say what,
7:48
if anything, you can do with that model to interpret some function onto that.
7:56
So this is just a reminder that you get obviously, you know, this you get three.
8:01
What is this is a reminder. Hopefully you get three different outputs from Alpha fold.
8:07
You get the coordinates, which is what you're kind of excited by.
8:12
That's the predicted structure. But you also get these measurements, measurements, you get these values.
8:16
Get these values that tell you something about the confidence the alpha forward has in the structure.
8:29
So the pldt is a measure of the local quality.
8:38
So that's where Alpha Folds says in the vicinity of this particular residue.
8:42
I think the local environment is well modelled, is confident or not, and it's going to colour.
8:47
Well, it's become customary to the colour code that pldt wear.
8:54
Blue is good, you know, pretty much as good as a crystal structure you might say Cyan.
9:00
A bit less so, but likely to be broadly correct.
9:06
And then these lower values where Alpha fold has no confidence and we shouldn't read anything into these coordinates here.
9:10
Those low confidence regions you might remember are some.
9:19
Sometimes they are simply bad predictions. And there are cases where I have made bad predictions.
9:23
That's a surprise. The reason I'm surprised about that is because generally it does very well, but it doesn't always do well.
9:30
And we'll come on to one reason why it doesn't always do well.
9:35
But often these regions of low confidence, you might remember, are what's called intrinsically disordered regions.
9:39
So these are parts of a protein which simply don't have a single well-defined structure and they are not uninteresting.
9:46
They can still have important functions. They're often involved in protein protein interactions where there's a little motif in
9:56
that disordered region that interacts with another protein in terms of their structure.
10:03
They are poorly defined, at least until they bind to something else.
10:08
And that's the explanation for a lot of the red and orange and yellow that you might see in a model,
10:13
especially in a eukaryotic protein where there's lots of disorder around.
10:18
We can see here, for example, this is the animal structure of this protein.
10:22
The ends of this protein are basically disordered floppy, waving around.
10:27
No particular structure, alpha fold will still give you a particular single structure,
10:33
but it's telling you it knows that that's one among many possibilities for that region, because it's a disordered part of the protein.
10:39
And then the second one, perhaps remember, this was in your assessment.
10:48
So this is a measure of the global confidence our fold has in the relative arrangement of different domains within a protein.
10:53
So here's a protein that has four domains. You can see the domain structurally here.
11:04
Each of them is light blue, which means alpha, for one, is pretty happy that it's got the fold of those four domains, correct?
11:09
That's fine. What about the question of how these domains are arranged with respect to each other?
11:16
Do they actually look like this with these four domains arranged like this, or could it be something different?
11:23
The page here is telling us quite clearly that this is simply one among many
11:31
possible ways in which those four domains could be packed against each other.
11:36
How do we know that? We might remember these are the reliably predicted domains, little squares on the diagonal,
11:40
where within say, residues 1 to 18 alpha fold is very confident.
11:48
In other words, there's a low predicted error here. So this is all happy days between this domain and this domain.
11:54
This is very light colour, which means that the predicted error is very high and Alpha Fold essentially has no confidence whatsoever
12:01
that the way those two domains are arranged with respect to each other in 3D space is correct.
12:09
It could be like this, it could be like it could be anything. And that makes sense when we look at it,
12:13
because we can see these long disordered linkages between the domains and that imply that confers a degree of flexibility between those two domains,
12:19
which means that their relative orientation is not well-defined.
12:30
So people are arriving late. And that's in contrast to this protein here, where with the exception of this long loop, it's one big,
12:37
well-defined structural block where everything is confidently arranged with respect to other residues in the protein that makes sense.
12:48
You remember all that now? Domains and P So you'll come back to these ideas as we're going along.
12:58
I didn't spend much time on this because you probably remember this and you'll be doing this again tomorrow.
13:08
So you can make your own alpha fold models quite easily on a page.
13:13
Just a reminder, you will need to be locked in with a Google account.
13:20
But everybody had that for 71, so I assume you haven't been kicked off Google in the meantime.
13:24
You can say that again tomorrow.
13:29
But there's also the database. Of course, these well, don't need to go through these.
13:34
These are the pldt, the P that you get when you make a colourful model.
13:42
We'll talk about this again in a second.
13:50
This is telling you how many homologues for your protein of interest Alpha four manages to find and you'll see that's really important.
13:52
So just to talk through that, here's a protein that's just over 200 residues long.
14:01
You can see the number of sequences down the left. This is going up to thousands here and this is the sequence identity to the query.
14:07
So this is summarising, if you like, what you might get.
14:14
It's not using blast, but it might use blast and it's finding all of the homologues in the database, making it with alignment.
14:18
And it's saying I've got about about 100 really close homologues with 90% sequence identity
14:25
and I've got maybe 2000 Homologues that I can find for all or part of the protein,
14:33
mainly with the lowest sequence identity. You'll see that the number of homologues that alpha fold find for your protein is really important because
14:39
it uses that information to make the model and if it lacks that information is likely to make a bad model.
14:48
That's what I'm showing you here. So I'm not going into the details of it here.
14:57
But there's an idea called evolutionary covariance.
15:04
What that means is that in a big alignment of protein sequences, you can read out connections, relationships between individual residues.
15:08
For that to work, you need a deep alignment. So you need that alignment with many sequences as we've got here.
15:19
In this case, it was all good. There were 2000 or so sequences and that allowed us to make a really good model.
15:26
In this case, there's only one or two sequences in the database that are similar to the protein that we're interested in.
15:34
So this is a challenging case. The relevance sequences in the database that are unrelated to anything else, they're called singletons.
15:41
So one sequence with no homologues at all that you can find.
15:50
What that means is that Alpha Fold can't determine this evolutionary covariance information and it produces much lower quality structures as a result.
15:54
So here is the actual structure of the protein.
16:09
We know that because it's actually a crystal structure, this protein.
16:13
But if you ask how to make a model without reference to the crystal structure, of course it does a very bad job.
16:16
And that's because as well as the protein sequence itself, there's only one homologue in the database.
16:23
So the key message is that you need lots of sequences related to your protein to make
16:31
a good model and alpha fold struggles when you have only a few sequences to write it.
16:38
Funnily enough, there's a bit of an exception to that.
16:46
People have realised that Alpha Fold is very good at making models of artificial proteins and of course an artificial protein and a natural protein.
16:49
It doesn't have any homologues because we've invented some completely novel protein that's unrelated to something in nature.
16:58
But nevertheless Alpha Fold can make good models of that.
17:05
And the idea is that those models work well because you can perhaps see that
17:08
these models are very sort of perfect in a sense of they're very well packed,
17:15
the lots of regular second restructure, not many loops.
17:19
And so they're kind of easier. They're more perfect, more ideal proteins than natural proteins.
17:23
And so Alpha four can still make a model of them. Does that make sense?
17:31
I realise I may have skipped a slide about evolutionary covariance I plan to go into,
17:37
but essentially the idea is that in a big alignment you can spot relationships between residues
17:42
and say these two residues must be close together in 3D space just to be related in that way.
17:48
And if you don't have a big alignment, you can't extract useful information.
17:55
So make some kind of sense. Any questions on that?
18:00
So that's the kind of key feature of Alpha forward.
18:08
And the important consequence of that is that these are the kind of proteins alpha forward is going to struggle with.
18:10
There's not many of them, to be honest.
18:16
If you were to take a random protein and do a database search with it, you probably find hundreds or thousands of homologues.
18:17
But in certain kind of weird organisms that have perhaps not been explored very much before,
18:24
you can still find proteins that are pretty much unique or very small families, and then Alpha Fold will struggle with them.
18:30
Okay, so. A little bit on databases.
18:40
Again, this part is a reminder there is a database of alpha forward structures.
18:47
Alpha four protein structure database has come this grown over the past few years.
18:54
Now it's about 200 million. There is a version for, but that's not interesting addition to version three.
19:00
So these are predictive structures from Alpha Fold on a on a very large scale.
19:09
You've seen that before. What you haven't seen.
19:15
Just to make you aware is that there's another database along very similar lines called the same message Islamic Atlas.
19:18
It's about three times bigger than the Alpha four database.
19:28
So this is already huge, 200 million proteins in it.
19:31
This has about six a million proteins.
19:35
What they've done here is use a different modelling method called ESM forward, which works in a completely different way.
19:39
It's also a deep learning method.
19:46
It doesn't work quite as well as Alpha fold, which is why I'm not talking about it in the same detail, but it's much quicker.
19:48
And that's allowed them to work with an even larger number of protein sequences.
19:55
So there's a database of metagenomic sequences.
20:02
Everybody must know by now what metagenomics, as you've been doing all of the genome assembly and stuff.
20:06
So metagenomics is kind of sequencing that environment and seeing what's there in a kind of unbiased way.
20:11
So what you end up with is vast numbers of sequences, but without the actual quality annotation that you get a unique process.
20:19
But this is a big structural database that you could use and more or less the same way as you would down for full database.
20:29
So. So we've got these big databases of protein structures and there was a very urgent need for
20:39
was a way of searching those databases efficiently because the methods for searching the PDB,
20:48
which is a much smaller database, 200,000, the best methods to do that are really slow.
20:56
So they just simply don't scale up to the challenge, the Alpha Fold database, much less the Metagenomic Atlas.
21:02
So there was a big need and some very smart guys came up with some software,
21:10
which is really important software in this area called Fold Sake, which allows us to search those databases in a very efficient way.
21:15
So in terms of sensitivity, in terms of giving us good results, it's almost as good as Dali.
21:26
Dali is kind of the gold standard in the area, but it's very, very slow.
21:33
So it's no use for searching these big databases. So it's almost too sensitive, but much, much faster.
21:38
And there's a a server which you'll use quite sophisticated now, which does this very quickly.
21:45
So you're searching these databases in seconds. It's absolutely amazing.
21:52
Just to give you a flavour of how they've achieved this efficiency.
21:57
What they do is they encode a3d structure as a1d string, and that allows them to work with the string in the same way as you would a protein sequence.
22:02
So you kind of capture all of that 3D complexity and a string, which is much more computationally tractable.
22:14
So how do they do that? They look at each position in, in the protein and they,
22:24
they measure distances between amino acids and they define for each amino acids a
22:34
kind of an alphabet that describes its relationship to its nearest neighbours.
22:41
So they will look at nearest neighbour, nearest neighbour residues.
22:48
They will measure these distances.
22:53
There are still more distances there than 20, but they use a kind of they find a way to collapse down that information into 20 states.
22:55
Why do you think 20 states can only want to see y y 20?
23:08
What's the coincidence or it's not a coincidence. What's the where have you seen the number 20 before?
23:13
Exactly. It's 20 amino acids. So what that means is they can simply borrow all of the software,
23:19
all of the algorithms that were written to work with 20 amino acids and work with 20 states that represent the 3D structure of a protein.
23:25
And this allows them to be very efficient.
23:34
So you'll see this tomorrow. This is what you get.
23:40
These are the databases you can search and you can search the PDB can search out four fold, various derivatives of it very cleverly.
23:43
You can use a taxonomic filter. So if you only want to look in bacteria or you only want to look in mammals,
23:54
you can type a term here and it will only give you the results from within that group that you've specified.
24:02
And then the results that you see these look a lot like.
24:11
Blast results. So your your query is laid out here.
24:17
Our query here is just over 200 residues. And we're seeing these are that colour coded.
24:22
So dark blue is a lower value.
24:28
And you can see each of those bars represents a structure in the Alpha Fold database, which has a similarity to our query structure.
24:33
So we're fed in a structure. It can be a model, it can be a pretty structure, doesn't matter and out and fold.
24:43
Seek is telling us it's found all of the similar structures in the Alpha Fold database, and then you can click on one of them.
24:51
You click here and you get a little panel that gives you an alignment.
24:59
This is all very much like you would see with blast results, but then you see the structural alignment as well.
25:03
You can swivel it around and so on. You can explore all of this tomorrow.
25:10
So one little question you might be having is if the Alpha fold database is so huge and it has models for me,
25:16
why am I interested in learning how to make my own models?
25:23
And there's a lot of answers to that question. Some of them relate to the database specifically, some of them relate to Alpha fold.
25:27
Some of these will come on to in the next lecture or in the workshop.
25:35
So proteins have different conformations, so an enzyme can be in an inactive form.
25:40
In an active form, the database may have the inactive form.
25:47
You might want a model of the active form, so you might want to model something that's different to what's in the database.
25:52
This is not something that four fold can currently do.
26:01
But it's interesting that the next generation of Alpha fold and Rosetta fold will be able to do this.
26:04
So post-translational modifications, things like phosphorylation bound ligands.
26:10
No software can currently do that, but within this year there will be software to do that, which is amazing.
26:16
We've talked about this that models of orphans actually use the word singleton and orphan
26:25
is another word for a protein that doesn't have a family that doesn't have any homologues.
26:34
So this is where Alpha Fold will struggle.
26:39
But in the database, for example, this links to what you've been learning in previously in this module that there
26:45
is such a thing as splice variants that lead to different protein isoforms.
26:52
You've come across that, right? Yeah. So in the database you get one structure for that protein and it may or may not be the isoform that you want.
26:57
So maybe it's built a model of one isoform you'd like a different Isoform So therefore you need to go and build your own in the database.
27:05
Very large proteins can be missing, or in the case of very large human proteins, are split into chunks and you have to work harder to get them.
27:16
So it might be easier to make your own. In the Alpha four database, there are no complexes.
27:25
So if your proteins attach from A and you want to build a tetra, you have to build it yourself.
27:31
If your protein interacts with another protein and you want to model that interaction, you have to do it yourself and you'll do that next week.
27:36
Next week's workshop will be that.
27:45
And then just relating to the points about the alignment, the the models in the database, they're already a year or 18 months old, right?
27:47
So if you were if that model was built for one of these orphan singletons, a kind of protein alpha fold struggles with,
27:57
it may be that in the past year, 18 months more sequences have come along which allow you to build a better model.
28:08
So more sequences coming along all the time. Those proteins that were previously difficult may become less difficult and they become good.
28:14
So the model in the database may not be the best model you can make given the number of sequences that are available today.
28:23
Does that make sense? So lots of reasons why you do need to learn to make your own modules.
28:31
I mean, you can have a quick look at the database and that might do the job,
28:38
but in any of these circumstances, you'll need to generate your own modules.
28:41
Right. So that's a little bit of revision and expansion of ideas you've seen before.
28:47
Moving on to now is thinking about how we can read out protein function from the models that we make with alpha fold as just moved up and up.
28:56
Are there any questions at that point? Yeah.
29:10
Yeah. I mean, first of all. Oh, right.
29:23
Well. Well, that's a real can of worms.
29:29
We should talk about another time, because an interesting perspective on that that I just don't have time to go into right now.
29:35
But I mean, most people you talk to would like to maintain a distinction between,
29:41
you know, crystal structures, crime structures and armour structures,
29:48
structures where you can collect some data on a big fancy instrument and you determine
29:51
the structure and then something that's merely been predicted by a computer.
29:56
Most people will say something, even something very clever like unfold as being in a different category and fundamentally less trustworthy,
30:01
less reliable, a different kind of data.
30:10
There is a sort of counter view to that, which we can talk about another time, but you're talking to most people.
30:14
You will see a distinction between an experimental structure and a predictive structure, and people will say, I trust an experimental structure.
30:23
I'm automatically a little bit sceptical about predictive structure.
30:30
And so, yeah, it was, it was.
30:34
It was the language that was sometimes used.
30:40
So if people if someone told you they determined the crystal structure, you would automatically think of an experimental method like crystallography.
30:44
And only a minority of people, but possibly a minority of people with some good reasons would say, Well, these days,
30:55
maybe I should consider Alpha fold as a kind of a different modality of structure rather than a fundamentally less reliable,
31:01
different category of strip. It's a long discussion.
31:11
It's an interesting one, but I will save that for another time, if that's all right.
31:16
Sorry. But yeah, it's a it's a really good question how you view different kinds of data and whether computational predictions are,
31:21
in fact fundamentally less reliable. I think there's two sides to that, definitely.
31:30
Right. So that's all about getting up.
31:36
So structures, how do we read function from those structures?
31:40
And this is just a reminder of perhaps the most basic idea, which is to say that if we can spot homology between two proteins,
31:45
then we might think that the functions are somehow similar or perhaps even the same.
31:54
And this is not new to you in any way, of course, because all of the work that you've done with Blast and PSI Blast is about saying, Look,
32:00
I've got an E value that's really low, that tells me these proteins are homologous and therefore I think they might have the same function.
32:06
If you've thought through all of this logic before,
32:14
all that's new here is the idea that structural information is a more powerful way to determine to detect homology than sequence information.
32:17
And the reason for that is illustrated here.
32:28
We've got two proteins and at first glance they look really, really similar, but they're only 30% sequence identical.
32:32
That's not super low. Of course, you could probably detect that with PSI blast.
32:40
That's no problem. But what this is saying is that 69% of these residues are different, and yet that structure is more or less maintained.
32:43
So as evolution proceeds over millions of years, mutations occur, but many mutations don't change the structure.
32:56
So the structure of another way of viewing it, if you like,
33:05
the structure allows us to look back further in time and see relationships that were defined longer ago.
33:08
It's more powerful. We can look back further than we can with sequences.
33:17
Sequences may allow us to look back a certain period of time, but we can look back further if we have structure and information.
33:22
So that's why structures are so useful.
33:31
And here's an example of this, But you may just remember a program because I mentioned it in 71 called H.H. Pred.
33:34
I won't go into any of the details, but H.H. Create is basically the most powerful way of detecting relationships using sequences.
33:44
So it's the absolute pinnacle of what you can do with sequences.
33:54
And here's a protein that we were interested in that we looked at with h h h h.
33:58
Pred finds matches in the PDP and P from wherever you like.
34:04
And we got lots of easy matches for this part here, which is a membrane transporter domain doesn't really matter.
34:09
So this 300 residues here, we could see absolutely nothing by sequence methods, even this really powerful sequence method.
34:15
And yet we tried it with alpha fold. Alpha fold gave gives us this model, this chunk here, all this multicoloured stuff is this membrane region here.
34:27
The purple domain is within this part here.
34:39
It was completely invisible when we looked by sequence, but when we made a model alpha fold found this domain.
34:42
And more than that, this domain actually made a lot of sense.
34:50
So this domain, when we used forward seek on it, we looked for structural similarities.
34:53
It turned out to look like a gold domain. Doesn't matter what a gold domain is, but that makes sense.
34:59
With what we knew about the behaviour of the protein. The key point is that was completely invisible here.
35:04
It was only when we used a structural perspective that we could see that homology and that allowed us to say,
35:10
well, maybe this part of this protein has this particular function, has this particular domain set up.
35:16
You see the point. This is an absolutely key thing.
35:23
This is alpha fold as turbocharge this whole area of spotting cosmologies and inferring function from them.
35:25
And it's important to try different methods when we looking for homologues.
35:37
Otherwise you can think you've got something new and you actually don't.
35:42
So a quick example of that was this protein, which there was a paper came along that said, Oh,
35:47
we've found the super exciting new fold, but they didn't actually look in the most sensitive way.
35:54
When I looked in a different way,
36:01
I could see the relationships we can see visually with this other protein that kind of made sense with the function again.
36:03
So the the message here is that like so many things in bioinformatics, the smart move is if you're really,
36:11
really interested in a question is to try and apply different methods and look for a consensus view.
36:19
And that's actually what we end up doing a lot in this kind of function annotation area.
36:27
We apply different ideas and if they're all pointing in the same direction, then we think we're onto something.
36:34
All right. Just keeping an eye on the time.
36:42
Another database that that's relevant in this area is called Alpha Phil.
36:47
I'll describe the database and then I'll show you how it's relevant to us.
36:55
Alpha Phil tries to add back Lykins, drive Alpha, fold models in the database.
37:01
So like I said before, Alpha Fold doesn't do ligands yet.
37:06
So the Alpha Fold database is full of proteins, many of which have ligands, sometimes super important ligands, but they're missing in the database.
37:10
So here's a globin, for example.
37:19
We know this globin should really be binding a theme group because that's fundamental for what it does, but that's absent in the Alpha four model.
37:22
So Alpha Phil will try and say, okay, here's my model.
37:30
I can match this to a globin in the PDP.
37:35
I can see that the binding site for that Haem group in the PDP structure, the experimental structure is conserved in this Alpha four model.
37:38
So I can kind of transplant the ligand from the PDP structure into the Alpha fold model and kind of add back the missing ligand.
37:49
So to that structure. How is this relevant?
38:00
Well, many times you are you will take a model that you're interested in.
38:04
You'll query the Alpha four database and you may have, if you're unlucky, in a sense,
38:11
you may have a protein fold which is associated with different functions.
38:18
So the easy case would be my protein fold always binds DNA.
38:22
That protein fold whenever you see it across the whole of nature, always binds DNA.
38:28
That's easy because as soon as you spot that fold, you say it's binding DNA job done.
38:32
If it's harder, then you have a fold like here, even the globin fold, which is famous for binding haem.
38:38
In some organisms, it's adapted to do other functions.
38:46
So what this means is that if you recognise a globin fold in a protein that you're interested in,
38:50
you may not be clear whether it's binding haem in this conventional way or whether it's binding this fatty acid as it does in certain bacilli.
38:56
But you could use alpha filter spots that some model was either compatible with the haem as here it was compatible with binding the fatty acid.
39:06
So you could kind of read out from the alpha filled database which ligand fits
39:18
into your model and therefore which function was more likely for your protein.
39:24
So that makes sense. Okay.
39:30
I just keep see where I am. 42.
39:36
Okay, So. What I want to do now is go through a bunch of different methods.
39:40
They're all based on looking at a protein structure, scanning that protein structure and trying to find.
39:47
Interesting functional sites. So the first step of my.
39:57
Yeah. So the general principle that we're applying here is the functional sites,
40:06
the parts of the protein surface that are important for the function, that they are different somehow from the protein surface in general.
40:12
And this is the basic principle that allows those in very different ways to scan a protein structure and spot sites,
40:21
which may be finding ligands, maybe catalytic sites, because they're different in some way.
40:28
So I'll just go through these relatively quickly.
40:37
You'll see some of these in the workshop tomorrow.
40:40
This is possibly the most important of them, actually, because it's such a general idea.
40:46
So the general idea here is that if a region of the protein is important for the function,
40:51
maybe it's a binding site, then it will be conserved through evolution.
40:58
Because evolution, if you if you try to mutate this ATP binding site of this kinase, for example,
41:02
you would eliminate the activity of this enzyme and that would be bad news for the organism that was that was had this mutated version.
41:10
And therefore we wouldn't see that mutated sequence in the evolutionary record.
41:18
That organism would die out and that mutant would be invisible.
41:23
So we can detect the importance of these binding sites because the residues within them are conserved.
41:28
More than that, we know that these binding sites are composed of residues from from far apart in the sequence.
41:37
They come together close in 3D space to make the binding sites.
41:48
So the right way for us to look for these binding sites is with 3D information and mapping the conservation onto the surface.
41:52
So in this particular view of a protein kinase, red means highly conserved.
42:01
And we can see that the ATP site that's absolutely essential kinase needs to bind.
42:07
ATP is very red. We can see the peptide site is quite red.
42:12
There's another site here.
42:17
This interacts with the protein that is quite red and there's also residues which are the centre of the protein which are for structural regions.
42:18
So when we're looking for functional sites, we're looking for surface science because something is binding at that surface which are conserved.
42:28
And I will skip that little bit of detail for now.
42:37
Um, another very simple way to look for binding sites is just by analysing the shape because pocket's cavities,
42:43
they are the binding sites for proteins generally.
42:55
You know, here for example, single chain enzymes, the catalytic site is the largest.
43:01
83% of the time. So if you had a structure of a single chain enzyme,
43:07
you could determine the catalytic site very easily just by saying, where's the biggest pocket on this protein?
43:14
That's very easy to do. You look at the shape. There are lots of bind traumatic methods that will pick out cavities, clefts pockets.
43:20
The biggest one is very likely to be the catalytic site. And so there are programs and databases like Caspi which will find the cavities.
43:28
So the green here is indicating residues that lie in a cavity in the protein.
43:41
And sure enough, that's exactly where this lipid is finding here.
43:46
So it's a very general principle. One little cautionary note with these Alpha four models, of course, here's a PDB structure.
43:50
This is a nice, tidy protein. This is a kinase.
44:02
This is the catalytic site. Sure enough, the largest cavity here is the catalytic site.
44:06
What people sometimes forget is that your model may have a lot of this disordered region.
44:13
This is the same protein in the Alpha four database, and a lot of this kinase is this red disorder and sort of low quality stuff,
44:21
which means that the shape of the protein looks very odd.
44:32
If you give that to Caspi, you get an absolutely meaningless result.
44:36
So you would need to trim off all of this disordered parts.
44:41
Just give Kaspi the nice folded domain and then you get the result.
44:45
So just be a bit careful with our four fold, two model, um, electrostatic characteristics.
44:51
This is also very easy to look at. Hymel has an option to do this.
44:58
You'll see it tomorrow. You can very quickly. They paint a protein surface according to whether it's positively charged or negatively charged.
45:02
You need to well, ideally, you have a memory of which is which.
45:11
Blue is positive, red is negative. Why is this important?
45:17
Well, here's a DNA binding protein. DNA is negatively charged, of course.
45:21
So the positively charged patch here is linked to its function of binding the negatively charged ligand, in this case, DNA.
45:26
And then the opposite is shown here. This is an enzyme with a positively charged substrate.
45:35
And so you can see all around the catalytic site here, we've got this huge quantity of negatively charged region,
45:40
which is kind of sucking the positively charged ligand in to the catalytic site and making the enzyme more efficient.
45:48
So we can spot these big blue or red patches and think whether they may be related to the function of our protein.
45:55
And then there are specific kind of trends that we can spot for protein for binding sites of different kinds.
46:05
So looking ahead slightly, this is the kind of slightly more traditional view which is still very relevant.
46:15
But this is these are the kind of features which the deep learning methods I'm talking about next week will be capturing.
46:23
So just just to join the dots there slightly.
46:29
So what people have noted for a long time, you can see this is 2007 is the carbohydrate binding sites in purple here.
46:33
They are rich in certain amounts of residues and certain residues compared to the protein surface in general.
46:41
So if you look, for example, at W, which you know is tryptophan,
46:50
you can see there's a lot more tryptophan in carbohydrate binding sites than there is in other ligand binding site.
46:54
So if you have a site, maybe a pocket, maybe a conserved pocket and you see lots of trips of fans,
47:01
you might start thinking, aha, maybe this is a carbohydrate binding site.
47:08
So it's tryptophan is another aromatics and we can see why,
47:13
why they are favoured in carbohydrate binding science is because they kind of sandwich a kind
47:19
of plain a sugar group here between the two aromatics and this is a favourable interaction.
47:27
So we see a lot of this carbohydrate binding sites.
47:33
Yeah, I will mention this one just because it's so counterintuitive.
47:41
Actually, that's not counterintuitive.
47:45
That's not quite the right word. But this is a kind of empirical method which is purely based on statistics.
47:49
Some people have not got some great underlying theory about why it works.
47:56
Just observe that it does work.
48:03
So the idea here is to represent all of the different kinds of atoms and all of the different residues with just 13 different atom types.
48:06
And if you've got 13 different atom types, it turns out that you can make a triangle with three of those in 455 different ways.
48:18
So if you imagine a triangle of atoms on the surface of the protein that can where those three can interact with,
48:29
for example, of water simultaneously, there are 455 triplets, as they're called, by this method.
48:35
And essentially in a purely observational, empirical way,
48:44
people notice that some of these triplets are much more common at binding sites than other triplets.
48:48
And then once you've made that observation, then you can use it to predict where the binding site is on a novel protein here.
48:55
So you can see it's been painted according to this propensity here where red means we've got lots of these triplets that are found in binding sites,
49:03
and blue means we don't have many of them at all.
49:12
And you can see it's picked out of the binding site perfectly just by analysing these triplets and the statistics of.
49:16
And then just another category of methods.
49:26
Unfortunately, I can't show you these because both of these services are no longer currently working, I should say.
49:33
But another idea in this area is to say, okay,
49:41
if I if I take a molecular probe and I kind of calculate where that probe interacts favourably with the protein,
49:44
I can perhaps directly predict where the binding site is.
49:54
And you have different probes for different binding sites. So carbohydrates, they have a lot of hydroxyl groups, of course.
49:59
So you can say, okay, I'll scan the protein surface, where will a hydroxyl group bind favourably?
50:05
And we can we can calculate that using our ordinary understanding of chemistry
50:12
and then we can paint the surface where a hydroxyl group interacts well.
50:17
And sure enough, that's exactly where this carbohydrate binds.
50:21
And the same shown by this other method where these little pink spheres are favourable points for the probe.
50:25
And again they're picking out the actual binding site.
50:31
So all of these different ideas and again, this would be another kind of.
50:34
The data which will feed into the deep learning methods that you'll see next week.
50:41
And then finally, just to mention, because it's an interesting idea, actually, is that everything until now is about finding binding sites.
50:47
There are a different class of methods for finding catalytic sites.
50:56
Catalytic sites are special because they're going to do some chemistry.
51:00
And one way in which you can find them very clever is by spotting residues that are that have an unusual PKU value.
51:05
So this requires us to remember what peak value is.
51:16
So if you've got an ionised apple group, like an acidic group, the peak value is the p h when it's 50% charge and 50% uncharged.
51:20
So it's a measure of the p h, which you've got 5050 ionised and ionised.
51:29
And the key observation is that residues that are doing the chemistry,
51:38
they often have anomalous peak values compared to what they would ordinarily have.
51:43
So an aspartic acid, for example, that would have a peak value typically at about three.
51:49
If you spot one that's got a peak value of seven. That's very unusual.
51:55
That tells you that this enzyme has evolved to change the environment of that aspartic acid to manipulate its peak.
51:59
And the reason it's going to do that is because that will enable it to do the chemistry that this enzyme wants to do.
52:07
So here is an example. Here is what a histidine usually looks like.
52:15
A peak of about six. These are the normal ones.
52:20
This histidine 95 in this particular protein tris phosphate, I summarise as a peak point five here about three.
52:23
That's very, very unusual. The reason for that is that it's participating in the catalytic site.
52:32
So and we can take a structure, we can predict peak values and we can spot residues that are unusual.
52:39
Again, unfortunately this server doesn't work right now.
52:48
But if you had this challenge in real life, you would be able to quite easily find software that would predict the peak values.
52:51
Perhaps spot this histidine as being unusual and allow you to say maybe that histidine is part of a static site.
52:58
I think really out to. Oh, I'm definitely running out of time.
53:08
What there is here is a bunch of slides from a real world example where I applied.
53:12
I and several of the people applied a bunch of different analyses to a particular protein structure.
53:20
So you can kind of look through that if you like. And I'm happy to talk about that, obviously.
53:28
But that probably the key method is, is capture it here.
53:34
When I said before about multiple methods what you want to do with a challenge here, the challenge was, what's this protein doing?
53:40
Where is it doing it? Our conclusion was it's an enzyme of this kind and we could annotate the the catalytic site.
53:48
But that came from many, many different lines of evidence.
53:56
Most of them based on the structure, all of which pointed in the same direction.
54:00
So you're looking for consistency. You're looking for a cavity which is also conserved.
54:06
That's two things pointing in the same direction, saying this is a catalytic site.
54:12
And when you have a whole big list of things, then you're making a very strong case if they're all consistent and pointing you in the same direction.
54:17
So you might want to have a look at those slides and see how we put the story together.
54:26
So just to conclude, and I'll see you again tomorrow, we can reinforce all of this with some actual in the workshop.
54:33
Obviously, the main point here is that this field has changed hugely recently because our four fold two has come along.
54:45
It produces brilliant models. Often it produces bad models sometimes.
54:52
And you now understand what kind of proteins line is to produce those models.
54:58
If you've got a model which you're confident is really high quality and you know how to how to determine that, now you should do that.
55:05
You can basically treat that as you would an experimental structure and apply all of the many, many different tools for structure based annotation,
55:17
apply them to the model as they were previously be applied to the actual experimental structure.
55:27
One of the key points here is we talked about this in detail is that homology is
55:37
more easily detected by structural similarity than it is by sequence similarity.
55:41
Remember that gold domain that was completely invisible by sequence comparisons?
55:48
We've seen quite a lot of the different structures of function methods,
55:54
and there are some new deep learning methods coming along with kind of mixed success.
55:58
I would say that you'll see next week, which will take structure any structure and give you some kind of function prediction based on it.
56:03
And then a slightly more subtle point, which is a bit hard,
56:13
but you would we can talk about this some more is so as well as knowing whether you can trust the Alpha four model,
56:15
you need to know whether whether the structure it's a function method requires
56:25
a really high quality structure or whether it's kind of tolerant of error.
56:32
So just to give you a couple of examples of the electrostatic statics,
56:36
if you think about the electrostatic that's defined by one side of the protein has, I don't know,
56:40
four positive charges, it doesn't matter if those four positive charges are in exactly the same place,
56:45
you will still have four positive charges on one side of the protein.
56:51
So that would be in a method that was tolerant of error.
56:55
He could have quite big mistakes in the positions of those positive charges and they would still be on the same side of the protein.
57:00
They would still give you a very similar result. So there would be an analysis that you could justifiably do on a kind of medium quality model.
57:07
You don't need to worry whether it's perfect in every detail. But the PCA one, for example,
57:15
you would really need a high quality structure to do that because the peak
57:22
prediction depends very much on the environment of that residue to be incorrect.
57:28
And so if you've got some even quite small mistakes in the environment for that reason, do that peak prediction is just going to be wrong.
57:34
So it's hard to get all of this across in the time available.
57:42
But bear in mind that some of these methods are fine to apply to even these models,
57:47
whereas some of them really require top quality models and you need to have a little
57:54
bit of that in mind when choosing which methods to apply to what kind of model.
57:58
Makes sense. Good. Well, I've taught much more than I was planning to, but it's gone plus ten.
58:05
But. Okay. Sorry about that. I hope you're not rushing off somewhere else.
58:14
Bye. See you tomorrow afternoon, isn't it? And we'll see if some of these methods.
58:20
For real.
58:25

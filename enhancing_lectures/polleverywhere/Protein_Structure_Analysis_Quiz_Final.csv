Activity,Type,Title,Option,Option 1,Option 2,Option 3,Option 4
Poll,Multiple choice,What is the primary purpose of predicting and analyzing protein structures?,To enhance the flavor of food products,To improve computer processing speeds,To predict the weather more accurately,***To understand the functions of proteins,To develop new sports equipment
Poll,Multiple choice,"Which method has taken over the protein structure prediction world, according to the lecture?",Machine Learning,***AlphaFold,Quantum Computing,Neural Networks,CRISPR-Cas9
Poll,Multiple choice,What kind of regions in a protein can AlphaFold predict that are very relevant to understanding protein function?,***Intrinsically disordered regions,Exclusively ordered regions,Constantly mutating regions,Fully crystallized regions,Static charge regions
Poll,Multiple choice,What is a crucial aspect of using AlphaFold models for understanding protein functions?,Ignoring the quality of the model,Focusing only on the size of the protein,***Assessing the predicted quality of the model,Considering only the proteins of known structure,Limiting analysis to human proteins
Poll,Multiple choice,What is an important consideration when applying structure-to-function analysis methods to AlphaFold models?,The color of the model visualization,The size of the protein database,***Whether the method requires high-quality structures,The geographical location where the protein was discovered,The age of the protein in evolutionary terms
Poll,Multiple choice,"According to the lecture, why is predicting the 3D structure of proteins essential?",To determine the evolutionary history of the protein,***To understand the biological function of the protein,To categorize proteins into different families based on their size,To estimate the energy consumption of the protein during synthesis,To prepare proteins for crystallization studies
Poll,Multiple choice,What is an intrinsically disordered region in a protein?,A region with a rigid and well-defined structure,A segment that folds into multiple structures spontaneously,A part of the protein that cannot be predicted by current methods,***A portion of the protein that does not assume a stable 3D structure under physiological conditions,The region of the protein that can be easily crystallized
Poll,Multiple choice,What is the significance of conservation in protein structure prediction?,Conserved regions indicate parts of the protein that can mutate without affecting function,Conserved regions are usually less important for the protein's function,Non-conserved regions provide the most reliable information for structure prediction,***Conservation can indicate functionally important regions in the protein,Conservation of protein structure is necessary for efficient protein degradation
Poll,Multiple choice,Which statement correctly describes the relationship between protein sequence and structure?,The sequence identity of proteins is the most reliable way to determine structural similarity,***Protein structure is more conserved and can reveal homology better than sequence alone,Structural information is less informative than sequence information for detecting homology,Protein structures are not useful in understanding evolutionary relationships,Sequence alignment is always more accurate than structural alignment for predicting function
Poll,Multiple choice,Which computational method is used to predict whether a given residue in a protein has an unusual pKa value and might be part of a catalytic site?,Molecular docking simulations,Homology modeling,Protein-ligand interaction predictions,Conservation mapping,***Empirical pKa prediction algorithms
